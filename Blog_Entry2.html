              <p> As I am writing this it is about a month into summer and let me tell you it has flown by! I went to Maine with some friends, continued my reading and studying and somehow ended up at Ash Brokerage. I am a web developer there, or rather here, as well as some other odds and ends that they have me work on. I have learned so much from working here, far more than what I did at IU. College classes are built to build foundations and show you what to expect, they do not offer any sort of real expierence. This expierence is what trully makes oyu learn how to function in the world and earn money. This expierence, along with some cash, is what I gained at Ash. </p>
              <p> I am very greatful to my dad and the men at Ash who let me work here despite my infancy in the world of development. I plan to continue to grow in my programming knowledge and pursue another summer of programming work next summer or even next semester. Speaking of next semester, I have another internship set up down at IU. It is one organized by the college and I will be hired out by local non-profits to help them with what ever needs they have regarding technologies within their businesses. I feel like I might be over-qualified for the job but it will be a good opportunity to help others and who knows, I might just learn a thing or two. </p>
              <p> Hopefully, this summer continue to go just slendid and ends as exciting as it started! We will be moving back to the wonderful town of Bloomington Indiana, getting more paychecks, and reading lots of intriging books. I hope that my girls will be able to all get to come see me somewhere. I may just have to make a surprise visit to Danville to see a certain two girlies. We really need to get together and plan that, I think that our best best will simply be congragating in Indy, but in the end it will probally not be my decision. Regardless of all the scary and nerveracking moments I've had thus far, this summer has been one that I will not soon forget and I am greatful for every second of it. </p>
