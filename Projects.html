<h3> Project Descriptions </h3>
<p><b>Informatics Study:</b> This was a rather in-depth research project that I performed for a Social Informatic class at IU. The only requirement for this study was to base it around algorythms. As you know, this is a rather broad topic so I focused in on Facebook's algorythms, how they work and how they affect their users. To my surprise they change the entire dynamic of how people recieve news and other crucial information! To read more about my study click and the blue icon above and read through the research proposal.

<p><b>IT Intern:</b> I worked, or am currently, working at Ash Brokerage as an Intern. My daily work varies from hardware installment to business analytics. My main job was to work with the varius department within the company and design and program custom websites. I worked with the infastructure, marketing, and human-relation departments to re-face their sites, subsites, and databases to keep them up and running. I will most likely come back to work for the same people next summer and be offered full- time employment, which I will be very hesitant to take if at all. Still, it has been the best internship of my life and I am very glad to have taken it. You can take a peek at some of the work I did during my time there via the green icon above.

<p><b>Indiana University:</b> Woot! Woot! Hoosiers Baby! College is one of the best decicions I have ever made, I met so many people and learned so many different things there! I loved every second of it and would gladdly go back. I earned a major in informatics with minors in business and philosophy. I found myself down in B-town and hope that others have the same oppertunities that I had! My favorite classes that I took would be all of my informatics and philosophy classes, if you are curious to what those were feel free to check out all of my papers and projects through the red icon above.
